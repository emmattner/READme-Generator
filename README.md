# Good README Generator

## Description
This week I created a README Generator by using the integrated terminal using node.js and installing inquirer. Inquirer is an npm package that can be used to gather and collect information from users by them inputting their data into the terminal command line. By gathering all input from users it will thyen create a README file for the user.

## What I have learned
I learned how to use my integrated terminal and node.js. Using npm you can install packages such as inquirer that will help aid in gathering information from users and generating a file.
